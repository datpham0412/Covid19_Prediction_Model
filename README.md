## üìã Project Description
The **Covid 19 Prediction Model** is a comprehensive tool designed to predict the spread and impact of Covid-19 using historical data and advanced statistical techniques. The model leverages multiple data sources, including Covid-19 case data and mobility data, to provide accurate forecasts and insights into the pandemic's trends. The project aims to assist policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the general public in understanding and responding to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and model training.
- **C++**: For efficient data processing and handling large datasets.
- **SQLite**: Database management for storing and querying data.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building predictive models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **CMake**: Cross-platform build system.
- **Google Test**: Unit testing framework for C++.
- **Dill**: For model serialization in Python.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

## üìö Features
- Fetch and preprocess Covid-19 and mobility data from multiple sources.
- Integrate and clean data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- Create various date-based, lag, and rolling average features to enhance model performance.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict new Covid-19 cases.
- Visualize actual vs. predicted cases, residuals, and other key metrics to interpret model performance.
- Generate detailed reports and visualizations for data exploration and model results.
- Support for user-defined country data extraction and analysis.
